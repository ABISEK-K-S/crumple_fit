        <h2>Dyeing</h2>
      </header>
      <div class="w3-container">
        <p>Dyeing in textiles is a process in which color is transferred to a finished textile or textile material (like fibers and yarns) to add permanent and long-lasting color. It can be done by hand or by machine. Dyes can come as powders, crystals, pastes or liquid dispersions, and they dissolve completely in an aqueous solution like water. When the textile and the dye come into contact, the textile is completely saturated by the dye and colored.
Unlike paint, dyes actually change the crystal structure of substances. The details involve a long chemistry discussion, but what you really need to understand is that dyes are more saturating and more permanent. This is important because you want the fabric color to last through many wearings and washings. And yes, most dyed textile material is used to make clothing.

        <h2>Fabric</h2>
      </header>
      <div class="w3-container">
        <p>First step in creating fabric is yarn production. Here, the raw materials that have been harvested and processed are transformed from raw fibers into yarn and threads. ... This process of joining the yarn together is called weaving. Weaving is done on a machine known as a loom and requires two sets of yarn.
        	Burn-out: Fabric treated with a chemical process that leaves sheer patches
for an edgy look.
<br><b>Combed cotton: </b><br>Fine brushes are used to eliminate short strands and
straighten

bers, making the fabric stronger, softer, and smoother.
<br><b>Jersey:<br></b> A stretchy knit typically made from cotton or a synthetic blend, it’s
very
exible and comfy.
<br><b>Linen:</b><br> Made from the

ax plant, the textured weave dries quickly, making it

cool to wear. However, it wrinkles easily.
<br><b>Modal:<br></b> A form of rayon made from plant

bers, it has a beautiful drape and a
slinky feel. It resists shrinking but can be prone to pilling, so avoid the dryer.
<br><b>Organic cotton:</b><br> Cotton grown with minimal fertilizers and pesticides.
Usually softer and more expensive than treated cotton.

Pigment dyed: A coloring process that coats the outside of the

America. Supima is the trademarked name for 100 percent American-grown
Pima cotton. Both resist pilling, fading, and stretching and get softer with
wear.
Polyester: Maintains its shape well and resists shrinking and wrinkles. Not
breathable.

<br><b>Rayon:</b><br> A breathable man-made

ber made out of trees, cotton, and woody

plants. Has a silky hand, yet wrinkles. Also called viscose.
